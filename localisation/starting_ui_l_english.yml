However, the rule was not welcomed by many of the people leading to a mass revolt of peasant farmers against their aristocratic lords. After a year of revolts, the local peasants which had organised themselves into numerous collectives came together and established a democratically elected Congress to represent their interests. This Congress quickly gathered and managed to establish a peace with Piedmont. A victory, they managed to get the Crown of Piedmont to relinquish their claims over the revolting lands. Even when the legions of Rome tried to incorporate the lands into their growing Empire, the Congress managed to repel the invaders. The Congress started to expand their influence. The Congress has representatives from local collectives all across the realm of Italia, including Rome. However, they only have limited control compared to the North where they have no foreign powers occupying the collectives. The Congress is evidently not a nation, but a group of collectives in and out of the territory they occupy."
